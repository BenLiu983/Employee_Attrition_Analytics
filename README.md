What major factors does the management team of a bank consider when they decide to grant a loan? This question is preoccupying the minds of loan applicants around the world. Understanding this, I initiated to discover several factors which may play an important role in how a bank calculates the credit score of loan applicants, utilizing a mix of statistical analysis, visualization and machine learning models.

This project is based on a dataset that contains information about 1 million potential borrowers of a specific bank, which is a peer to peer lending bank based in Ireland. The complete dataset is from Lending Club, and it has been changed from Kaggle. The goal of this report is to predict the credit score of loan applicants with high accuracy, as well as drive business insights. 

# Methodology
First of all, I conducted exploratory data analysis and generated visualization. After that, k-NN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and LightGBM were applied on the dataset to predict the credit score of loan applicants.

# Data Preparation
After feature selection, the target dataset contains nearly 1 million records and 9 major features, including 4 numeric features and 5 categorical features.
