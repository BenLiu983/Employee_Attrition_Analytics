# Employee_Attrition_Analytics

# Introduction
Research results from https://toggl.com/blog/cost-of-hiring-an-employee :

*Hiring and retaining employees are extremely complex tasks that require capital, time and skills.

*Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income such as hiring.

*Companies spend 15%-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate.

What major factors influence the employee's resignation? This question is preoccupying the minds of business owners around the world. Understanding this, I initiated to discover several factors which may play an important role in staff's turnover rate.

This project is based on a dataset that contains information about 1,400 employees and 35 features. The complete dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset. The goal of this report is to discover the factors impact the employees attribution and develop a model to predict the result.

# Methodology
First of all, I conducted exploratory data analysis and generated visualization to extract insights. After that, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and ANN were applied on the dataset to predict whether the employees are more likely to quit.

# EDA
The target dataset contains 1470 rows and 35 features
